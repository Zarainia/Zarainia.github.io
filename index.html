<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Between February 15 and March 20, 2020, I flew 100 GSF matches on my primary character on Star Forge, Sprigellania, and 100 GSF matches on a new character, Svetlana Vesna and recorded all of them (okay, there was one I apparently either recording or uploading on Svetlana, and the only record I have of it was a note saying it was "not very interesting", so I substituted the 101th match). All matches were played while solo-queued, and both characters were Imperial. To keep everything consistent, I transferred enough requisition using legacy grants to master the Mangler and Sting on Svetlana and set them to the exact same builds (which is listed on my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MaIOf6-y9fUE122mkG4jV0QXO3RTecQ'>T1 gunship</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MaIOf6-y9fCIhM17smRAVsF6_2sBSc3'>T2 scout</a> playlists on my YouTube channel, but basically it's a classic slug/ion/evasion gunship and a BLC/pods scout with booster recharge). On Sprigellania, I kept my usual full bar of 5 ships, though I only flew the Mangler and Sting; on Svetlana, I had only the Mangler and Sting on my bar. I usually flew Mangler in TDMs and Sting in Domination, but there was no restriction on this. I tried to fly the same way on both characters, focusing mainly on winning matches. I mostly avoided speaking on Svetlana to reduce the chance of outing myself, and changed up a few minor things, including how fast I selected a ship (I would wait until the last second on Sprigellania, but on Svetlana I selected it earlier) and which satellite I first flew towards in Domination. I don't think anyone knew who I was despite both characters having the same legacy, and I also tried to do my class story (Sith Warrior) on Korriban and Dromund Kaas rather than staying on the Fleet to avoid people running into me and inspecting me. I tried to fly at the same times on both characters, at approximately 21:30 to 22:40 or 23:40, depending on whether I had to get up early the next day. Sometimes I forgot and got on the wrong character; in those instances, I tried to fly balance it out as quickly as possible while maintaining the same ratio of types of days (i.e., weekends vs. weekdays). I never left due to a premade being around or losing too much (not that I ever do normally).</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this experiment was to (a) determine the qualitative and quantitative differences between playing on a character with a known name and a character with an unknown one, (b) compile various various performance stats for my solo queue flying in more detail than is possible by solely using the stats tracked in-game and without being affected by previous matches and grouping, and (c) compile various miscellaneous stats relating to assignment of maps, etc. that I've always been curious about. One question was whether I would do better on a new, unknown character where there would be presumably less attention on me. I have always found it easier/more pleasant to fly on my main characters rather than new characters even after the new characters had mastered ships, and I wondered if it was just due to the memory of having new ships on the new characters or whether there was any real merit to this.</p>
<h2>Method</h2>
<p>Each video was recorded by constantly recording the last 15 minutes of gameplay using Nvidia's GeForce Experience. I trimmed the videos and auto-generated part of the description using a Python script I wrote for this purpose using OpenCV to manipulate the images and Tesseract for OCR. Unfortunately, sometimes it would trim too much from the end, so in a few of the videos, the scoreboard is not visible, and because I took the scores using the scoreboard screenshot, there was no stats data for those matches (I excluded them from the stats per match entries). I also tried to take screenshots of the scoreboard of each match, but only a fraction of them seemed to be there when I looked at them. So I'm not sure what was up with that but I resorted to getting the screenshots from the videos directly. For each match, I also recorded my thoughts on it and put that in the video description, though some of them were really unmemorable.</p>
<p>To get all the IDs and therefore the URLs for each video, I used the YouTube Data API and exported the data to a json file (<a href='100_matches_stats_get.py.html'>script</a>). I then downloaded all the screenshots of the final frames of these videos using <code>youtube-dl</code> and <code>ffmpeg</code> and read the stats line corresponding to my character's name as best I could (I had to do some manual adjustments) using Tesseract again (<a href='100_matches_read_screenshot.py.html'>script</a>). Finally, I did the calculations in Python and exported the <code>prettytable</code> to HTML before writing this and doing some touchups (<a href='100_matches_stats_compile.py.html'>script</a>). I made the plots with Python's <code>matplotlib</code>. For the entries labeled 'close', I defined a close match as one where the difference of the scores divided by the higher score was less than 0.2.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why I didn't use the in-game stats window, well, I managed to forget to take screenshots at the right time, and apparently, the screenshots I did get only covered half of the window even though I was sure I took screenshots of the top and bottom halves. Maybe there's a rate limit for screenshots.</p>
<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>Qualitatively, I didn't feel a big difference between flying on Sprigellania and flying on Svetlana. I felt that I had some people focusing me on Svetlana from the beginning, so it didn't feel easier to fly on that character. Actually, it felt slightly easier to fly on Sprigellania, maybe because I got to talk to people?</p>
<p>Quantitatively, the stats were actually quite similar between the two characters. The win rate on Sprigellania was slightly higher (by 2 matches), but that's likely within the margin of randomness. Interestingly, and probably contrary to most people's experience, my KDR was generally slightly higher on Sprigellania. Interestingly, I had both more kills and more deaths on Svetlana.</p>
<p>To the surprise of approximately no one, my win rate was much better in TDMs, and especially, Lost Shipyards TDMs, than Domination. After all, it's possible for me to get a bunch of kills and eke out a win, but carrying a Domination is much harder. My personal stats were also better, probably because I could just shoot things in my gunship rather than worrying about pesky things like objectives, and kills/deaths actually matter (though maybe not the ratio, exactly). I am also better at gunship than scout, and I always flew gunship in TDMs while I flew it occasionally in Domination.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that there were generally more Domination matches than TDM, and that Lost Shipyards TDMs were much less common than other maps (sadly for me). Also, from the graphs, there was one day on Svetlana where I played super late, starting at around 23:00 and ending at about 23:50, and another day where the losses greatly outnumbered the wins. Likely, there was a premade flying on that day that I was often put against, which probably affected the other stats as well. Also interesting to note is that the matches per day vastly increased after around March 13, when I started working from home due to the Coronavirus since I saved the commute time.</p>
